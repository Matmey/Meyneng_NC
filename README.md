## **Rawdata availability**

### Amplicon sequencing targeting 18S-V4 rDNA

Amplicon sequencing targeting 18S-V4 rDNA come from ECOMINE project (https://www.cresica.nc/projet/ecomine) and are available as raw sequence (https://doi.org/10.12770/62cde5b9-1888-4b2c-b8a5-a490a696b078).

For this study these sequences has been processed using SAMBA v4 available here: https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/samba 

### Amplicon sequencing targeting ITS rDNA

Amplicon sequencing targeting ITS rDNA were performed by the sequencing platform of Tartu University and processed by NextITS pipeline (https://github.com/vmikk/NextITS.git). Raw sequencing data are available on demand (vladimir.mikryukov@ut.ee).
